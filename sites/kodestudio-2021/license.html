    <p class="text-justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 3, 29 June 2007<br><br> Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <br> Everyone is permitted to copy
        and distribute verbatim copies<br> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preamble<br><br>&nbsp;The GNU General Public License is a free,
        copyleft license for<br>software and other kinds of works.<br><br>&nbsp;The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>to take away your freedom to share and change the works.&nbsp;By contrast,<br>the GNU General Public
        License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>software for all its users.&nbsp;We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>GNU General Public License for most of
        our software; it applies also to<br>any other work released this way by its authors.&nbsp;You can apply it to<br>your programs, too.<br><br>&nbsp;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, notprice.&nbsp;Our General Public Licenses
        are designed to make sure that you<br>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of
        it in new<br>free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br><br>&nbsp;To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.&nbsp;Therefore, you have<br>certain responsibilities
        if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br><br>&nbsp;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the
        recipients the same<br>freedoms that you received.&nbsp;You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>or can get the source code.&nbsp;And you must show them these terms so they<br>know their rights.<br><br>&nbsp;Developers that use the GNU GPL
        protect your rights with two steps:<br>(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br><br>&nbsp;For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL
        clearly explains<br>that there is no warranty for this free software.&nbsp;For both users' and<br>authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>authors
        of previous versions.<br><br>&nbsp;Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>can do so.&nbsp;This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim
        of<br>protecting users' freedom to change the software.&nbsp;The systematic<br>pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.&nbsp;Therefore, we<br>have designed
        this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>products.&nbsp;If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>of the GPL, as needed to protect
        the freedom of users.<br><br>&nbsp;Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish
        to<br>avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>make it effectively proprietary.&nbsp;To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br><br>&nbsp;The precise terms
        and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>modification follow.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>&nbsp;0. Definitions.<br><br>&nbsp;"This License" refers to version 3 of
        the GNU General Public License.<br><br>&nbsp;"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>works, such as semiconductor masks.<br><br>&nbsp;"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>License.&nbsp;Each
        licensee is addressed as "you".&nbsp;"Licensees" and<br>"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br><br>&nbsp;To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other
        than the making of an<br>exact copy.&nbsp;The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br><br>&nbsp;A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>on the
        Program.<br><br>&nbsp;To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>computer or modifying
        a private copy.&nbsp;Propagation includes copying,<br>distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br><br>&nbsp;To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation
        that enables other<br>parties to make or receive copies.&nbsp;Mere interaction with a user through<br>a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br><br>&nbsp;An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>to
        the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>extent that warranties are provided),
        that licensees may convey the<br>work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.&nbsp;If<br>the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br><br>&nbsp;1.
        Source Code.<br>&nbsp;The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>for making modifications to it.&nbsp;"Object code" means any non-source<br>form of a work.<br>&nbsp;A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either
        is an official<br>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>is widely used among developers working in that language.<br><br>&nbsp;The "System
        Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br><br>Component, and (b) serves only to enable
        use of the work with that<br>Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>implementation is available to the public in source code form.&nbsp;A<br>"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>(kernel,
        window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br><br>&nbsp;The "Corresponding Source" for a work
        in object code form means all<br>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>control those activities.&nbsp;However, it does not include the work's<br><br>System
        Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br><br>which are not part of the work.&nbsp;For example, Corresponding Source<br><br>includes interface definition
        files associated with source files for<br><br>the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br><br>linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br><br>such as by intimate data communication or control
        flow between those<br><br>subprograms and other parts of the work.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br><br>can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br><br>Source.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;The
        Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br><br>same work.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;2. Basic Permissions.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br><br>copyright on the Program, and
        are irrevocable provided the stated<br><br>conditions are met.&nbsp;This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br><br>permission to run the unmodified Program.&nbsp;The output from running a<br><br>covered work is covered by this License only
        if the output, given its<br><br>content, constitutes a covered work.&nbsp;This License acknowledges your<br><br>rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;You may make, run and propagate covered
        works that you do not<br><br>convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br><br>in force.&nbsp;You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br><br>of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or
        provide you<br><br>with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br><br>the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br><br>not control copyright.&nbsp;Those thus making or running the covered works<br><br>for
        you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br><br>and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br><br>your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Conveying under
        any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br><br>the conditions stated below.&nbsp;Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br><br>makes it unnecessary.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;No
        covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br><br>measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br><br>11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br><br>similar laws prohibiting
        or restricting circumvention of such<br><br>measures.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br><br>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br><br>is effected by
        exercising rights under this License with respect to<br><br>the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br><br>modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br><br>users, your or third parties'
        legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br><br>technological measures.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br><br>receive it, in any medium,
        provided that you conspicuously and<br><br>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br><br>keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br><br>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to
        the code;<br><br>keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br><br>recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br><br>and
        you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br><br>produce it from the Program, in
        the form of source code under the<br><br>terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;it, and giving a
        relevant date.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;released under this License and any conditions added under section<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;This requirement modifies the
        requirement in section 4 to<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"keep intact all notices".<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.&nbsp;This<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;License
        will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;regardless of how they are packaged.&nbsp;This License gives no<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;permission
        to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate
        Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;work need not make them do so.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;A compilation of a covered work with
        other separate and independent<br><br>works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br><br>and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br><br>in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium,
        is called an<br><br>"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br><br>used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br><br>beyond what the individual works permit.&nbsp;Inclusion of a covered work<br><br>in
        an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br><br>parts of the aggregate.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br><br>of
        sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br><br>machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br><br>in one of these ways:<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical
        product<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;customarily used for software interchange.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;b)
        Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;long
        as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;product
        that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;conveying
        of source, or (2) access to copy the<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;written offer to provide
        the Corresponding Source.&nbsp;This<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;with subsection 6b.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;d)
        Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;further
        charge.&nbsp;You need not require recipients to copy the<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source along with the object code.&nbsp;If the place to<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;may
        be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding
        Source.&nbsp;Regardless of what server hosts the<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;e)
        Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;charge
        under subsection 6d.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br><br>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br><br>included in conveying the object code work.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;A
        "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br><br>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br><br>or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br><br>into a dwelling.&nbsp;In
        determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br><br>doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.&nbsp;For a particular<br><br>product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br><br>typical or common use of
        that class of product, regardless of the status<br><br>of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br><br>actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.&nbsp;A product<br><br>is a consumer product regardless
        of whether the product has substantial<br><br>commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br><br>the only significant mode of use of the product.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;"Installation Information" for a User Product means
        any methods,<br><br>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br><br>and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br><br>a modified version of its Corresponding Source.&nbsp;The information
        must<br><br>suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br><br>code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br><br>modification has been made.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;If you convey an object code work
        under this section in, or with, or<br><br>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br><br>part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br><br>User Product is transferred to the recipient in
        perpetuity or for a<br><br>fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br><br>Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br><br>by the Installation Information.&nbsp;But this requirement does
        not apply<br><br>if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br><br>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br><br>been installed in ROM).<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;The requirement to provide Installation
        Information does not include a<br><br>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br><br>for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br><br>the User Product in which it has been modified
        or installed.&nbsp;Access to a<br><br>network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br><br>adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br><br>protocols for communication across the network.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Corresponding
        Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br><br>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br><br>documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br><br>source code form), and must require
        no special password or key for<br><br>unpacking, reading or copying.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;7. Additional Terms.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br><br>License by making exceptions from one
        or more of its conditions.<br><br>Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br><br>be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br><br>that they are valid under applicable law.&nbsp;If additional
        permissions<br><br>apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br><br>under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br><br>this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;When
        you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br><br>remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br><br>it.&nbsp;(Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br><br>removal in certain cases
        when you modify the work.)&nbsp;You may place<br><br>additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br><br>for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provision
        of this License, for material you<br><br>add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br><br>that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting
        liability differently from the<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;author attributions in that material
        or in the Appropriate Legal<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;requiring that modified versions of such
        material be marked in<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;authors of the material; or<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;e)
        Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;material
        by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;those
        licensors and authors.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br><br>restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.&nbsp;If the Program as you<br><br>received it, or any part of it, contains a notice
        stating that it is<br><br>governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br><br>restriction, you may remove that term.&nbsp;If a license document contains<br><br>a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br><br>License,
        you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br><br>of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br><br>not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;If you add terms to a covered work
        in accord with this section, you<br><br>must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br><br>additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br><br>where to find the applicable terms.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Additional
        terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br><br>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br><br>the above requirements apply either way.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;8. Termination.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;You may not
        propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br><br>provided under this License.&nbsp;Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br><br>modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br><br>this License (including any
        patent licenses granted under the third<br><br>paragraph of section 11).<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br><br>license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br><br>provisionally,
        unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br><br>finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br><br>holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br><br>prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Moreover,
        your license from a particular copyright holder is<br><br>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br><br>violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br><br>received notice of violation of this
        License (for any work) from that<br><br>copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br><br>your receipt of the notice.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br><br>licenses
        of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br><br>this License.&nbsp;If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br><br>reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br><br>material under section
        10.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br><br>run a copy of the Program.&nbsp;Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br><br>occurring
        solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br><br>to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.&nbsp;However,<br><br>nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br><br>modify any covered work.&nbsp;These
        actions infringe copyright if you do<br><br>not accept this License.&nbsp;Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br><br>covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream
        Recipients.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br><br>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br><br>propagate that work, subject to this License.&nbsp;You are not responsible<br><br>for
        enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br><br>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br><br>organization, or
        merging organizations.&nbsp;If propagation of a covered<br><br>work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br><br>transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br><br>licenses to the work the party's predecessor
        in interest had or could<br><br>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br><br>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br><br>the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;You
        may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br><br>rights granted or affirmed under this License.&nbsp;For example, you may<br><br>not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br><br>rights granted under
        this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br><br>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br><br>any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br><br>sale, or importing the Program or
        any portion of it.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;11. Patents.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br><br>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.&nbsp;The<br><br>work thus licensed
        is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br><br>owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br><br>hereafter acquired, that
        would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br><br>by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br><br>but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br><br>consequence of further modification of the contributor
        version.&nbsp;For<br><br>purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br><br>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br><br>this License.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive,
        worldwide, royalty-free<br><br>patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br><br>make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br><br>propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;In
        the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br><br>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br><br>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br><br>sue for patent
        infringement).&nbsp;To "grant" such a patent license to a<br><br>party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br><br>patent against the party.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent
        license,<br><br>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br><br>to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br><br>publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br><br>then
        you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br><br>available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br><br>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br><br>consistent with the requirements
        of this License, to extend the patent<br><br>license to downstream recipients.&nbsp;"Knowingly relying" means you have<br><br>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br><br>covered work in a country, or your recipient's
        use of the covered work<br><br>in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br><br>country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br><br>arrangement,
        you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br><br>covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br><br>receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br><br>or convey a specific copy of the
        covered work, then the patent license<br><br>you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br><br>work and works based on it.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br><br>the
        scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br><br>conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br><br>specifically granted under this License.&nbsp;You may not convey a covered<br><br>work if you are a party
        to an arrangement with a third party that is<br><br>in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br><br>to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br><br>the work, and under which the third party
        grants, to any of the<br><br>parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br><br>patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br><br>conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br><br>for
        and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br><br>contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br><br>or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Nothing in this License
        shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br><br>any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br><br>otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;If
        conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br><br>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br><br>excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp;If you cannot convey a<br><br>covered
        work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br><br>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br><br>not convey it at all.&nbsp;For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br><br>to
        collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br><br>the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br><br>License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;13.
        Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br><br>permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br><br>under version 3 of the GNU Affero
        General Public License into a single<br><br>combined work, and to convey the resulting work.&nbsp;The terms of this<br><br>License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br><br>but the special requirements of the GNU Affero
        General Public License,<br><br>section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br><br>combination as such.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;14. Revised Versions of this License.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;The Free Software Foundation may
        publish revised and/or new versions of<br><br>the GNU General Public License from time to time.&nbsp;Such new versions will<br><br>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br><br>address new problems or concerns.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Each
        version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp;If the<br><br>Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br><br>Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br><br>option of following the terms
        and conditions either of that numbered<br><br>version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br><br>Foundation.&nbsp;If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br><br>GNU General Public License, you may choose any
        version ever published<br><br>by the Free Software Foundation.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br><br>versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br><br>public statement
        of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br><br>to choose that version for the Program.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Later license versions may give you additional or different<br><br>permissions.&nbsp;However, no additional obligations are
        imposed on any<br><br>author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br><br>later version.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
        BY<br><br>APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br><br>HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br><br>OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br><br>THE
        IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br><br>PURPOSE.&nbsp;THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br><br>IS WITH YOU.&nbsp;SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br><br>ALL
        NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;16. Limitation of Liability.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br><br>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
        AND/OR CONVEYS<br><br>THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br><br>GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br><br>USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
        TO LOSS OF<br><br>DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br><br>PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br><br>EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
        OF<br><br>SUCH DAMAGES.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br><br>above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br><br>reviewing
        courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br><br>an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br><br>Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br><br>copy of the Program in return
        for a fee.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;If you develop
        a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br><br>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br><br>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;To do so,
        attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp;It is safest<br><br>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br><br>state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br><br>the "copyright" line and
        a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Copyright (C) &nbsp;<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;it under the terms
        of the GNU General Public License as published by<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;(at your option) any later version.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;This program is distributed
        in the hope that it will be useful,<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp;See the<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;GNU General Public License
        for more details.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;along with this program.&nbsp;If not, see .<br><br><br><br>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic
        and paper mail.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br><br>notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copyright (C) &nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;This
        program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br><br><br><br>The hypothetical
        commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br><br>parts of the General Public License.&nbsp;Of course, your program's commands<br><br>might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;You
        should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br><br>if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br><br>For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br><br>.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;The
        GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br><br>into proprietary programs.&nbsp;If your program is a subroutine library, you<br><br>may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br><br>the
        library.&nbsp;If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br><br>Public License instead of this License.&nbsp;But first, please read<br><br>.<br><br></p>
