# Neon - static site generator (not sure)
Tools to display the repository's (GitHub) events on a timeline.

We don't know how to classify Neon. 

The most basic definition of Neon: is a tool to help you create websites. That site displays the latest information and events for your repository and sorts it on a timeline.

Neon is develop in "dev" branch

## Quick install Neon for your repository
Installing Neon is very simple. Neon is just a static website and you can install it anywhere. Here's how to install Neon into the repository through GitHub Page - because it is free.
### Step 1. Download the latest Neon release
You can find it at GitHub or download it directly from Kode's server.
### Step 2. Add Neon to your repository
#### Case 1: 
In your repository, create a new directory called "docs" or "docs". Then copy all files in the release you downloaded. Make sure you have the correct path to the "index.html" file. For example, your-repo/docs/index.html.
